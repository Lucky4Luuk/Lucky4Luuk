Hey, my name's Luuk and I develop whatever I find interesting.
Some interesting (I guess?) things about me:
- 23 years old
- ADHD
- He/him
- Currently in college

My biggest passion is definitely computer graphics, but I enjoy anything that is both interesting and provides a good challenge.
Also, I love using Rust, it's very swag
